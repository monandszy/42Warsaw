SSH on port 4242. Configure UFW (or firewalld for Rocky).

• The hostname of your virtual machine must be your login ending with 42 (e.g.,
wil42). You will have to modify this hostname during your evaluation.
• You have to install and configure sudo following strict rules.
• In addition to the root user, a user with your login as username has to be present.
• This user has to belong to the user42 and sudo groups.

• You have to implement a strong password policy.

To set up a strong configuration for your sudo group, you have to comply with the
following requirements:
• Authentication using sudo has to be limited to 3 attempts in the event of an incor-
rect password.
• A custom message of your choice has to be displayed if an error due to a wrong
password occurs when using sudo.
• Each action using sudo has to be archived, both inputs and outputs. The log file
has to be saved in the /var/log/sudo/ folder.
• The TTY mode has to be enabled for security reasons.
• For security reasons too, the paths that can be used by sudo must be restricted.
Example:
/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/snap/bin
